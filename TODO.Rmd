## For the current version
- Add a repair function to fix out-of-bounds vectors (and improve 
    *recombination_geo()*'s and *recombination_blxAlpha()*'s repair)
- think about using a standard notation for parameters in all recombination 
    operators (is it interesting or will it generate more confusion?)
- Error catching in *create_population()* (see file)
- Document *evaluate_population()*
- Include more recombination alternatives
- Add flag _record.everything_ to _ExpDE()_ (to return the whole history of the 
optimization, incl. intermediate populations)
- Add option to regulate the verbosity of the method.
- Add 'offspringnumber' option to the recombination routines (to simplify reuse, 
    e.g., for RCGAs or other extensions)


## For future versions
- Consider expressing candidate solutions as lists (useful to encapsulate 
meta-info about each vector in the population).
