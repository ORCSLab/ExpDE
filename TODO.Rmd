## For the current version
- Add a repair function to fix out-of-bounds vectors (and improve 
    *recombination_geo()*'s repair)
- review *recombination_blxAlpha()*
- update error catching in all functions
- think about using a standard notation for parameters in all recombination 
    operators (is it interesting or will it generate more confusion?)
- Error catching in *create_population()* (see file)
- Document *evaluate_population()*
- Include recombination alternatives
- Add flag _record.everything_ to _ExpDE()_ (to return the whole history of the 
optimization, incl. intermediate populations)


## For future versions
- Maybe use counters (iterations, function evaluations etc.) based on 
_mutable state_ operations. For instance (from Hadley's Adv R p.186):

```
new_counter <- function(n = 0){
  i <- 0
  function(n = 0){
  i <<- i + n
  i
  }
}
```

- Consider expressing candidate solutions as lists (useful to encapsulate 
meta-info about each vector in the population).
