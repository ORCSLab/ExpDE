- Error catching in *create_population()* (see file)
- Each mutation / recombination / selection operator must have its own 
  individual file, and follow the standard filename *operation_name.R* and
  standard function name *operation_name()* (e.g., *mutation_rand()*)
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
- Change names of _probpars_ parameters *lim_inf* and *lim_sup* to *xmin*, *xmax* (for uniformity with other projects)
- Add output fields _Fbest_ and _Xbest_ containing best point returned (for compatibility with other projects)
=======
- Document *evaluate_population()*
- Include recombination alternatives
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
