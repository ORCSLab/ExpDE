- Document new mutation operators (like in the paper)
- Add flag _record.everything_ to _ExpDE()_ (to return the whole history of the 
optimization, incl. intermediate populations)
- Consider expressing candidate solutions as lists (useful to encapsulate 
meta-info about each vector in the population).
- Add 'offspringnumber' option to the recombination routines (to simplify reuse, 
    e.g., for RCGAs or other extensions)
